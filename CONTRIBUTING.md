# Contributing to HasC

We welcome contributions to HasC! Our goal is to make hardware design more accessible and efficient. We value a fast-paced, agile development process, prioritizing quick iteration and collaboration.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the HasC repository on GitHub.

2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your fork for your feature or bug fix.  Name it something descriptive (e.g., `feature/new-schematic-symbol`, `fix/yaml-parser-bug`).

3.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your feature, fix the bug, or add the documentation.  We encourage you to follow these guidelines:
    *   **Keep it focused:** Each pull request should address a single, specific issue.
    *   **Write clear code:**  Strive for code that is easy to understand.
    *   **Add tests (if applicable):**  If you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug, consider adding a test to ensure it works as expected.

4.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.

5.  **Create a Pull Request:** Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch of the HasC repository.

## Our Agile Approach

*   **Fast Merging:** We aim to merge pull requests quickly, prioritizing progress over perfection.
*   **Minimal Requirements:** We avoid excessive requirements and documentation.
*   **Lightweight Code Review:** Code reviews are primarily focused on identifying potential issues and ensuring code clarity, not on nitpicking style or minor details.
*   **Embrace Iteration:** We encourage experimentation and iterative development.  Don't be afraid to submit a PR with a work-in-progress solution.
*   **No Requirement-Orgie:** We believe in keeping things simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Style Guide

*   **YAML:** Follow standard YAML conventions.
*   **Python:** Follow PEP 8 guidelines where applicable, but don't be overly strict. Consistency within the project is more important.
*   **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.

## Communication

*   **GitHub Issues:** Use GitHub issues to report bugs, suggest features, or ask questions.
*   **Discussions:** Use GitHub Discussions to discuss design decisions, share ideas, or get help.
